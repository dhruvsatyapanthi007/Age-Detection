# Age-Detection
Here, the person in the image is classified in the age group.
In this project, currently i have taken (0-20),(21-50) and above 51 as age groups for our project and database is of Wiki for images.
I am using Algorithms like Viola-Jones Algorithm for Face Extraction and Local Binary Pattern as Texture Operator
After this kind of preprocessing on the dataset, I am using Multiple Support Vector Machine for each group on this input as this is multi-class classifiction problem and prediction will be an age group of that person which i have made
